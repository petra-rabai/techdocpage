     <p>This section provides detailed information on key C# language features and features accessible to C# through the .NET Framework</p>
    <p>Most of this section assumes that you already know something about C# and general programming concepts.</p>
    <p>If you are a complete beginner with programming or with C#, you might want to visit the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/intro-to-csharp/index" target="_blank">Introduction to C# Tutorials</a> or <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/tutorials/csharp/getting-started" target="_blank">Getting Started with C#</a> interactive tutorial, where no prior programming knowledge is required.</p>

  <section id="Datatypes" class="main-section">
    <header>Datatypes</header>
    <p>C# is a strongly-typed language. Every variable and constant has a type, as does every expression that evaluates to a value. Every method signature specifies a type for each input parameter and for the return value. </p>
    <p>A typical C# program uses types from the class library as well as user-defined types that model the concepts that are specific to the program's problem domain.</p>
    <p>The information stored in a type can include the following:</p>
    <code>byte b = byte.MaxValue;</code>
    <code>
      byte num = 0xA;  
      int i = 5;  
      char c = 'Z';
    </code>
    <p>The information stored in a type can include the following:</p>
    <li>The storage space that a variable of the type requires.</li>
    <li>The maximum and minimum values that it can represent.</li>
    <li>The members (methods, fields, events, and so on) that it contains.</li>
    <li>The base type it inherits from.</li>
    <li>The location where the memory for variables will be allocated at run time.</li>
  </section>
  <section id="Events" class="main-section">
    <header>Events</header>
    <p>Events enable a class or object to notify other classes or objects when something of interest occurs.</p>
    <p>The class that sends (or raises) the event is called the publisher and the classes that receive (or handle) the event are called subscribers.</p>
    <code>public class Button: Control
{
    public event EventHandler Click;
}
</code>
  </section>
  <section id="Arrays" class="main-section">
    <header>Arrays</header>
    <p>An array is a data structure that contains a number of variables which are accessed through computed indices.</p>
    <p>The variables contained in an array, also called the elements of the array, are all of the same type, and this type is called the element type of the array.</p>
    <code> string[] strings = new string[100];</code>
  </section>
  <section  id="Classes" class="main-section">
    <header>Classes</header>
    <p>A class is a data structure that may contain data members (constants and fields), function members (methods, properties, events, indexers, operators, instance constructors, destructors and static constructors), and nested types.</p>
    <p>Class types support inheritance, a mechanism whereby a derived class can extend and specialize a base class.</p>
    <code>abstract class A
{
    public abstract void F();
}</code>
